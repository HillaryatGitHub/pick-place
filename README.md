# IoT Based Pick and Place Robot 
This pick and place robot is an educational medium appropriate for college students in the pursuit to replicate industrial applications in masterbox aggregation of smaller products. This practice is also prevalent for part assembly at automotive manufacturing facilities. This device is equipped with ESP32-CAM for vision capabilities in differentiating different color of boxes. This project also utilizes arduino UNO as a microcontroller as an effective yet affordable option. 
## Components Used 
- #### 2 x SG 90 Servo (1.6 kgfcm) 
- #### 1 x MG 90 Servo (1.8 kgfcm - 2.2 kgfcm)
